/*
QUICK SORT: divide and conquer algorithm that recursively sorts elements into
two arrays by selecting a pivot (here, the last index of the subarray) and partitioning
the array around that pivot, sorting elements smaller than the pivot to one subarray and
larger elements to the other subarray until reaching the base case of an empty array
Time complexity:
    best case: O(n*log(n))
    average case: O(n*log(n))
    worst case: O(n^2) (chosen partition is always an extrema of the subarray)
Space complexity: O(1)
Stable
Better for arrays than linked lists
